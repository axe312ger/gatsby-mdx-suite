# Editing basics

This is a brief introduction on how to write, create and layout content with MDX.

It is easier to learn as it seems in the first place.

## What is Markdown

The Markdown syntax is intended to be as easy-to-read and
easy-to-write as is feasible.

It uses common patterns to format content which might be already known
to you from other sites like Wikipedia or some forums.

### Markdown example

```mdx
# Hello world

This is a paragraph.

This is another one with **some emphasized** text.
```

### Line breaks &amp; paragraphs
A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one
or more blank lines.

A single line break will not result in a line break when rendered.

Multiple line breaks will not reduce in a bigger gap between the
content.

If you want to enforce a line break without creating a new paragraph,
you can use the `<br/>` tag.

### How to keep an overview: Comments &amp; more

As soon your content gets longer, you can use the following tricks to
navigate easier:

* Use multiple empty lines to visually group and separate syntax.
* You can use HTML comments for yourself to label sections. `<!-- Important content here -->`

## MDX

With MDX we can add more complex layouts and interactive elements to the content.

> MDX is a superset of Markdown. It allows you to write JSX inside markdown.

This is achieved by adding a few simple tags the syntax, which will look very familiar
if you know HTML already.

They may work completely independently, accept configuration via attributes but also can
support wrapping other content.

### MDX example

```mdx
# Hello world

This renders an internal image of the page, with all optimizations applied.

## Example image

<Image id="randomImageId" />


## Example images in a multi-column layout

<Columns>
<Image id="randomImageId" />
<Image id="randomImageId" />
</Column>

```

**Important:** To ensure these new tags are detected properly, ensure to separate
them with an empty line from regular Markdown content.
